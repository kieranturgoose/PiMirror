This video shows a walkthrough of my project, PiMirror. 

It starts by showing how the facial recognition recognises me as a user, and loads my configuration interface. A second user then enters, and is recognised. This makes my configuration terminate, and the second user's configuration is loaded. Finally, when there is no user present, the loaded interface automatically turns off.

After this, I go through all the main functions of my Android application. I log in; show how to connect to the Pi; show how to set the weather API needed for the Weather Forecast module; show how to configure modules in each of the available positions; save the modules; turn the mirror on from the app; turn off the mirror from the app; and sign out.

Lastly, I show the configuration file that has been changed by the Android application upon hitting save. This is how the PiMirror interface loads the modules.
